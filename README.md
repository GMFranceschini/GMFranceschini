### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

You can call me Gian. I am a PhD candidate in computational biology, interested in cancer epigenetics and method development.
I trained as a biotechnologist and quantitative biology, and I thrive between R, Python and the Unix terminal.

Sometimes I tweet interesting stuff [here](https://twitter.com/GMFranceschini), and here's my [website](https://gmfranceschini.github.io/)! 

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on DNA methylation patterns in cancer 

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to apply statistical techniques to complex biological problems

ðŸ’¬ Always up for a chat about science, or anything else interesting!
