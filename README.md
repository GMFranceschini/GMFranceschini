### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

![](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=GMFranceschini)

I am Gian, a post-doctoral researcher in computational biology, interested in cancer epigenetics and method development.
I trained as a biotechnologist and quantitative biology, and I thrive between R, Python and the Unix terminal.

Sometimes I tweet interesting stuff [here](https://twitter.com/GMFranceschini), and here's my [website](https://gmfranceschini.simple.ink/)

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on DNA methylation patterns in cancer, with special focus on cell-free DNA applications.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m interested in the application of statistical and machine learning techniques to complex biological problems
