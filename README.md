### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

![](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=GMFranceschini)

I am Gian, a post-doctoral researcher in computational biology interested in cancer epigenetics and method development.
I trained as a biotechnologist and quantitative biologist, and I thrive between R, Python, and the Unix terminal.

Sometimes I tweet interesting stuff [here](https://twitter.com/GMFranceschini), and here's my [website](https://gmfranceschini.simple.ink/)
